# WallpaperKit

This is not only a modern desktop wallpaper framework for Macs, powered by Swift language, but also a universal API that bridges wallpapers from different kinds of wallppaer manager softwares such as Steam Wallpaper Engine, Dynamic Wallpaper, etc.



## Compatibility

This framework currently only works on macOS. Due to large reliance on Cocoa Framework to function. More operating systems will be supported in the future (in Swift definitely).



## Get Started



### 1. Meet wallpaper directory structure

Commonly, most wallpaper structures can be described as follows:

```
<wallpaper bundle name>
│
├── project.json
│
├── preview.gif / preview.jpg (image file)
│
└── <file.extension ...> (files used for displaying)

```
